# LAB 1 - Rank-2 and Rank-3 Tensor Contraction

The goal of this project is to create algorithms that can compute either the rank-2 or 
rank-3 tensor contraction. These two algorithms are ran using two parallelisation 
methods: PThread and OpenMP.

## General info
The project is written in C++. The main purpose of the project is to use parallelisation and 
compare the execution times between OpenMP and PThread. For each function, there is a timer 
that runs. The outputs of these timers are stored in the file time.log which can be retrieved 
once the code is compiled and runs successfully. The values of the tensors are generated from 
a random number generator. The tensor bounds have been restricted to 10, 20, and 30, but can be
adjusted to test scalability.  

## Technologies
* Editor - Visual Studio Code 1.55.1
* Compiler and language version - GCC/G++ 9.3
* Build Tools - Makefile

## Setup
Editor used is Visual Studio Code and the set up for the c++ environment can be found using 
[@Visual Studio linux guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)


## Compilation
To compile the project using the integrated terminal, run: 

$ make clean && make && ./main
$ make clean 

## Status
Project is: Completed
